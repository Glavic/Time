#Time
##Introduction
This is a class for dealing with times. A time is a portion of a day measured from midnight and is date independent. That is
to say that a given time today is indistinguishable from a time with the same value from yesterday or tomorrow.

For example:-

    08:00 yesterday === 08:00 today === 08:00 tomorrow

This class can add, subtract and compare times.
